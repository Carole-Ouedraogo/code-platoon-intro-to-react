Welcome to React development! This repo contains all the code from the workshop at Code Platoon on June 27, 2019 (and possibly some more code that we didn't get to).

Slides are included in both Markdown and PDF form. I've split up each step from the tutorial into its own commit, so you can follow along using the commit history.

If you need help, don't hesitate to ask!
